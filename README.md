# Library Search Engine

A sophisticated search engine for a library of text documents, built with Django. This project allows users to search through a large collection of texts (from Project Gutenberg) using both keyword search and advanced regular expression search.

## Features

- **Keyword Search**: Find books containing specific words or phrases
- **Advanced RegEx Search**: Use regular expressions for more complex search patterns
- **Intelligent Ranking**: Results are ordered by relevance and centrality ranking
- **Content Recommendations**: Get suggestions for similar books based on your search
- **Interactive Web Interface**: User-friendly interface with responsive design
- **Detailed Statistics**: View insights about the library and search patterns

## Project Structure

- **Models**:
  - `Book`: Stores book data and metadata
  - `BookIndex`: Indexes words in books for efficient searching
  - `SearchLog`: Logs user searches for recommendations
  - `BookClick`: Tracks which books users click on
  
- **Main Components**:
  - Search engine with keyword and RegEx capabilities
  - Centrality ranking algorithms (PageRank, Closeness, Betweenness)
  - Book recommendation system based on Jaccard similarity
  - Responsive web UI with Bootstrap
  - RESTful API for all functionality

## Technical Implementation

- Built with Django and Django REST Framework
- Uses algorithms from network theory for ranking
- Implements Jaccard similarity for content recommendations
- Employs efficient database indexing techniques
- Provides both API endpoints and rendered templates

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Django 4.2+
- Django REST Framework
- NumPy
- SciPy
- NetworkX
- NLTK
- Other dependencies in requirements.txt

## Setup and Running

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate it: 
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - Unix/MacOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Download required NLTK data: `python manage.py download_nltk_data`
6. Apply migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
7. Fetch books from Project Gutenberg: `python manage.py fetch_gutenberg_books`
8. Run the server: `python manage.py runserver`
9. Visit `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter NLTK-related errors:
- Make sure to run `python manage.py download_nltk_data`
- Or manually download required data:
  ```python
  import nltk
  nltk.download('punkt')
  nltk.download('stopwords')
  ```
